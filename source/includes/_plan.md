# Plan

My research provided a pretty clear path, so there's less choice here than I anticipated.

Here's the general order of operations:

1. Update the server
  * Add the /event(s) endpoints
  * Hook it into a database
  * Start the /admin client
  * Update the OF booth
2. Booth.next (web or ios)
  * Add the /filter(s) endpoints
  * web will generally run more snappily and be easier to make and will work on walls or browsers
  * I'd vote web but there isn't a 'wrong' choice on technical grounds
3. Booths.future (who even knows)

**1** will take a bit less than a week. Could get a start this weekend, put in an hour here-and-there before bed in NY, and be done by the time we see each other. That brings us to **2**

Once the real semester starts January 27th I work at about halfspeed (half a week per calendar week).

**web** will take about a week and a half. I could probably have it done by the first, with maybe some polishing by the 8th or 9th. Definitely in time for Jill Stuart, guaranteed.

**iOS** will probably take about two weeks. I'm less experienced with native-ios-web-graphics than with straight-up-web-graphics, so I'm not positive about this estimate. It could be a week and a half (more likely), it could be two and a half weeks (less likely). Factoring in school-halfspeed I wouldn't feel comfortable guaranteeing it for the Jill Stuart show, but it could quite possibly be done by the Jill Stuart show.

If you end up wanting iOS *and* web, take a week off the time for whichever I build second. (eg two weeks for iOS then another 4 days to add web on, or a week and a half for web then another week to add iOS)
