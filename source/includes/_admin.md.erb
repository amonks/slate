# Admin

<%= partial "includes/planned" %>

The admin client, viewers, and booths are all essentially different interfaces for communicating with the server, each tuned for a particular set of tasks.

We'll need an admin client [think website] for things like

* setting event information (filters, branding, tweet-settings)
* deleting particular gifs
* tracking stats?

## New Event Workflow

Let's say a customer calls up and wants a gifbooth at an event. Here are the steps that must take place.

1. Log into the admin website
2. Click 'new event'
    1. Enter metadata like date, title, links, or custom css
    2. Select existing filters from a list and/or upload some new ones
    3. Maybe create a login for the customer where they can promote gifs [...]
3. Install and plug in the booth
    1. The booth will automatically adopt the settings of the most current event, by date. If there are multiple events at once (permanent installation?), log into the *booth's* admin website and choose the correct event from a list.
